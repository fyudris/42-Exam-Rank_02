Exam Problem: Power of Two Masking
Assignment name: power_mask
Expected files: power_mask.c
Allowed functions: write

Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes a single positive integer as an argument and prints:

"YES\n" if the number is a power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...).

"NO\n" otherwise.

Bonus: You must use bitwise operations only to solve this.
(Do not use loops, multiplication, division, or modulo.)

If the number of arguments is not 1, or the input is invalid (e.g., not a positive integer), print just a newline.

Hints for Students:
A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set in binary.

In other words, n & (n - 1) is 0 if and only if n is a power of 2.
